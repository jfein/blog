Living in New York City isn't all adventure and dynamism. Unless you are wealthy the way no real person is, you probably have to settle for a living space that is cramped and cluttered. It is the project of Graham Hill, entrepreneur and treehugger.com founder, to come up with an ideal New York apartmentâ€”one with a small footprint, both physically and environmentally, and one that offers just as much beauty and functionality as a pad multiple times its size.

Hill's Life Edited apartment is a constantly evolving space. He is always tinkering and researching, looking to streamline the already spare cube in SoHo to its bare necessities. Still, what exists now seems completely livable with very few compromises. Even for a pack-rat like myself, there is an allure to its simplicity.

When you walk in, you encounter what is, at first glance, a small studio apartment. Within that cube are actually 8 functional spaces. The living room and office become the bedroom with a tug of a bookshelf. Open one of the closets and you'll find 10 stackable chairs that go around a telescopic dining table for large dinner parties. An entire guest room with bunk-beds and a closet is revealed behind a wall that slides out on tracks. And of course, a well-equipped kitchen and bathroom await.
